Onboard is the process of giving rookies access to the tools as well as information that they need in order to begin working. Onboarding is usually done by a Director who did the interview or by the Membership Chair. While there is usually little challenge in executing the tasks outlined here, the cost of not doing them can be high. Members may skip important meetings when they aren't added the internal calendar, they can miss out on important discussions when they can't check Slack. These situations can be very frustrating to the people involved.
