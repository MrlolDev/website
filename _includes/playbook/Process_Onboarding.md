This section outlines the process of getting new members into our organization.

While there is usually little challenge in executing the tasks outlined here, the cost of not doing them can be high. Members may skip important meetings when they aren't added the internal calendar, they can miss out on important discussions when they can't check Slack. These situations can be very frustrating to the people involved.

### Tool access

Every new member must receive access to the tools described in the [Tools page of this playbook](https://github.com/yalecs/playbook/wiki/Process:Tools).

- [**Slack**](https://yalecompsoc.slack.com)  
Managers must add the newbies to the relevant Slack groups.

- [**Trello**]()  
New members must be added to the board and to the YCS Team on Trello.

- [**YCS-IN mailing list**](https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in)  
New members have to be **added to the YCS Internal elilist**.

- [**Internal Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/render#details_2%7Cdtv-eWFsZS5lZHVfbjNoMWFqcHZ0b2YzdTFmcGI0Z2JhNGEzaG9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ-0-0)  
New members have to be **added to the YCS Internal Google calendar. Only users with permission to manage the calendar can share it with the new students, so make sure to communicate if you arenâ€™t able to add someone.

- [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQQmZJdGRJVUZrR00)  
New members have to be **added to the Google Drive YCS folder.

### Notice for recruiters

As we let new members in, remember to remove their application information from the Google Drive.
