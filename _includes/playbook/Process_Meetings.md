If you were part of an extracurricular organization before, chances are that you have mixed feelings about meetings. When done wrong, club meetings are a huge time sink that busy college students just can't afford. When done right, however, meetings are a powerful tool in coordinating a team and making progress.

In our club, we find that **meetings are the main reason why we are able to get things done, despite our packed schedules**. That is because we use meetings to enforce accountability, drive teams to face their issues and make progress. For college students with busy schedules, physical meetings with fixed times are the best way to get everyone on the same page and communicate critical things.

# Our Meetings

### Tips for hosts

If you are hosting a meeting

0. **Do your homework**  
Rule zero for hosting is to come prepared. Make sure you have a plan for what is going to be discussed during that time. It is good practice to ping the attendees beforehand, reminding them about the meeting and about work they are supposed to have done by then.

1. **Make a list of commitments**  
Once the meeting is done, you will want to know when to follow up about work.

2. **Ask for attention**  
It's OK to ask people to lower their laptop lids.

3. **Have a fixed meeting time**, then **start on time and end on time**  
It's a big responsibility to ask your team to take a bit of their day.
Stick to 30 minutes. Start on time, finish on time.

### Tips for participants
