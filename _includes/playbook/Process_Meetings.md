If you were part of an extracurricular organization before, chances are that you have mixed feelings about meetings. Often times, meetings can be ineffective time sink that busy college students just can't afford. __In our club, however, we find that they are the main reason why we are able to get work done, despite our busy schedules.__ That is because we use meetings to enforce accountability, drive teams to confront their issues and to make progress.

> For college students with busy schedules, face-to-face gatherings with fixed times are the best way to get everyone on the same page and communicate critical things.

# Our Meetings

Our typical member will attend two one-hour meetings per week.

## Sunday Night Live

Every Sunday at 8pm, during the course of the academic year, we all get together to share updates, discuss problems and socialize. The meetings last no longer than one hour, though members often stick around after that to talk in smaller groups. __Our chairs take turns in hosting each week.__

Here is how the SNL usually goes:

1. Around 15 minutes before, people start to come in, take a seat and chat.
2. The host starts the meeting on time with a summary of the events from the past week.
3. The host invites directors to make important announcements.
4. After that, the team leads take turns announcing their teams' latest updates.
5. The meeting ends and people disperse into groups to chat about work in the upcoming week.

### Engaging the room

A big challenge for hosts is keeping the mood up in the room. That's why we encourage everyone to interrupt the speakers with observations, ask questions, make jokes etc. It is also important that people making announcements stand up in the front and __engage the room__. The host, however, must also keep in mind the clock, making the speakers hurry when necessary.

Here are some good practices:

- Play music in the room before the meeting starts and leave it in the background afterwards. While it's easier for the host to have someone else be the DJ, the hosts can still pick the songs and perhaps start the SNL by describing what is playing.
- Start with a loud, energetic welcome to keep the mood up, and encourage people to clap.
- Ask that people put away their computers and cellphones.
- __Keep director announcements to under three minutes and team updates to under five.__
- Have people come forward to share a cool story about the impact of our work.
- Use the projector to show photos from the latest event, music videos, songs playing on the background etc.

## Board meetings

Board meetings happen every Wednesday night, from 8pm to 10pm. That is when all team leads and directors come together to discuss progress and issues. Before the board meeting, team leads must update their metrics on the spreadsheet.

__It's a big, loud mess.__ Good luck. (Srsly, though, we're gonna figure it out, John.)

## Team meetings

Team meetings vary a lot in format and duration and content, which are all up to the team to collectively decide. They must, however, have fixed meeting times and occur weekly. All meetings should be on the calendar.

### Tips for hosts

Every meeting has exactly one host, which is rotated when there are multiple team leads.

0. __Do your homework__.  
This is rule zero of hosting. Make sure you thought about what will be discussed/accomplish, keeping in mind the time available.

1. __Ask for attention__.  
It's OK to ask people to lower their laptop lids, or get off their cellphones.

1. __Start on time, end on time__.  
Meeting times are fixed, so everyone should be expected to arrive on time. You, however, have to make sure to end on time too.

### Tips for everyone

1. __Be lazy, don't work__  
This can vary from team to team, but it's usually a good idea to use the meeting slot strictly to discuss and plan, not to do work. We often realize during meetings that we forgot to do something important and we rush to do it immediately. But by completing tasks during meetings – however relevant – we usually throw ourselves off the important discussion going on, or, even worse, sometimes bring the discussion to a halt, as others are waiting for us to finish. Instead, write down what you have to do later – better, make a Trello card!

1. __Lean in__  
Share your views and don't hesitate to raise issues when you see them. Leadership is ownership! You have a responsibility to speak up when you disagree.

1. __5 minutes early is on time, on time is late__  
You don't want to be the one walking into a meeting after it's started. Plan to arrive at least five minutes early, so you have a couple of minutes to prepare.

### On absences

Absences in meetings come back to bite us in ways we can never foresee. That's why presence in meetings is so important. Being on time is also very important. Once a couple of people start coming in late, it takes effort and awkwardness to get everybody to show up in time.

> In a nutshell, it is _only OK to miss meetings for reasons that you can't plan around_. That includes being sick, or being out of New Haven for a competition. That does not include, however, doing school work, attending office hours, etc. _As soon as you know you will miss a meeting, let the chairman know._

> Absences in team meetings are taken case-by-case depending on the team lead.
