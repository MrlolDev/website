If you were part of an extracurricular organization before, chances are that you have strong negative feelings about meetings. You are totally justified. When done wrong, which seems to happen more often than not, meetings are a huge time sink that busy college students just can't afford. **But when done right, meetings are a powerful instrument to coordinate teams and get work done**.

### Why meetings matter

Imagine, for instance, a group of type A college students who decide to work on an extracurricular project together, by coordinating only through a group chat. Being high energy and ambitious, the members like to crowd their schedules with many extracurriculars and interesting classes. This project will likely face two big problems: first a lack of communication and then a lack of progress. To begin, group chats are usually. They are easy to.

Over the years, we have learned that groups with fixed meetings times and a leader on top of their shit.

We have found, somewhat counterintuitively, that **meetings are one of the reasons why we are able to get things done in our society, despite everybody's busy schedules**. That is because meetings enforce accountability and help us keep making progress. When we fix a time in the week to get the team together we, are helping each other be on top of their work.

**How do we keep our meetings from turning into huge time sink monster?** Glad you asked.

## Hosting effective meetings

Wait for the meeting to be over and **voice your concerns.**

0. **Do your homework.**  
Come to the meeting prepared.

1. **Be mindful of other people's time.**  
It's a big responsibility to ask your team to take a bit of their day.
Stick to 30 minutes. Start on time, finish on time.

2. **Keep it under control.**  

3. **Fix a time at the beginning of the project.**  
Demand adhrance.
