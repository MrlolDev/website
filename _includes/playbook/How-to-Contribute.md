Like most encyclopedias, this playbook will never be finished â€“Â it is a living document. Instead, we strive to keep it in sync with our latest ways of thinking and working.

### Keep in mind

Here are some tips you can benefit from while making your contribution to this playbook.

- Organization is key for any wiki. For this playbook to be useful, people must be able to navigate through it intuitively. Before starting a new page or section inside an existing page, make sure to explore the rest of the content. Ask yourself if the changes you are making really belong here.

- Always ask for feedback from other members before committing **new** content to the wiki.

- Install the [Grammarly for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en) extension, and make sure you use it to fix typos and grammatical errors. Alternatively, you can use [Yale College Writing Centers](http://writing.yalecollege.yale.edu) for a more personal touch. ðŸ˜‰
