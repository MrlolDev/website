### Final Tips

- Organization is key for any encyclopedia. For this playbook to be useful, people must be able to navigate through it intuitively. Before starting a new page or section within a page, make sure to explore the rest of the content. Ask yourself if the changes you are making really belong here.

- Update the Sidebar file (_Sidebar) to reflect changes whenever you create, rename or delete a page. This can be somewhat challenging, so remember to ask for help if you need it.

- Always ask for feedback from other members before committing **new** content to the wiki.

- Install the [Grammarly for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en) extension, and make sure you use it to fix typos and grammatical errors. Alternatively, you can use [Yale College Writing Centers](http://writing.yalecollege.yale.edu) for a more personal touch. ðŸ˜‰
