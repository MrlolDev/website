Our `teams` are groups of members working on a certain project. 

__At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a postmortem.__ After the break, the board can decide to continue the team, usually with some different members or goals.

### Team leads

Each team is assigned one or two `team leads`: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team to make progress towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report to their directors the updates on tasks and metrics.
