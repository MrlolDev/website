We rely on a few tools in order to work effectively.

### Planning and Executing

Our `Trello board` is the source of truth for our organization. We use cards inside our board to distribute work and keep track of everyone's tasks and deadlines. We can also use comments in to keep track of meeting minutes.

> `SHOULD` &nbsp; Every member should have access to our board and check it regularly.

### Communication

#### Slack

We use [Slack](http://slack.com) in order to communicate with one with one another. We usually have one big channel for each org (e.g. Events) and one channel per team (e.g. Talks). Our domain on Slack is [yalecs.slack.com](http://yalecs.slack.com).

Good communication a crucial quality for any organization. For this reason, it is very important that every one of our members be active on Slack. We strongly recommend installing in your phones and keeping it open in your browser.

**Note about Facebook Messenger**
Using Messenger for ephemeral communications with team members is OK. As a rule of thumb, Messenger groups shouldn't last more than a couple of days. Once that happens, please consider transferring that group to Slack.

#### YCS-IN mailing list

We use the [ycs-in mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in), managed by the Yale ITS, for some communications and reminders. Don't be afraid of using it.

### Metrics Sheet

The most important document in our Google Drive folder is our Metric Spreadsheet. It is used to keep track of the progress of our orgs, teams and sometimes of individual members. Managers often must pay special attention to this spreadsheet and update it weekly before meetings. [Learn more about our metrics system.](https://github.com/yalecs/playbook/wiki/Process:Metrics)

### Calendar

We use an internal Google calendar associated to yale.edu accounts to coordinate meetings. All new members should be given access to it and add it to their personal calendars.

### File Sharing

We use a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQa2lnd3Z0bTg4S3c) to keep all of our documents. We prefer adding documents to this Drive folder than sharing it with individual members using their emails. Our society strives for transparency and we trust each other, so there is rarely the need to keep any files relevant to our work outside of this folder.
