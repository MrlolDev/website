We rely on a handful of tools in order to work effectively.

### Trello

Our [board on Trello](https://trello.com/yalecomputersociety) is our single source of truth. _We use it to plan, delegate and follow up on all of our tasks._ Each team owns a column in our board where they keep their own cards. __Team leads must make sure that their columns reflect the current state of the team and that the members are updating them on a daily basis.__

> See more about how Trello works [here](https://trello.com/guide) and [here](https://blog.trello.com/topic/trello-news).

Here are some best practices that we follow:

- Use the [members feature](http://help.trello.com/article/807-adding-a-member-to-a-card) to delegate a task to someone. You can also [add a due date](https://blog.trello.com/mark-a-trello-card-as-done) and make it easier to know when to follow up.

- Keep columns ordered by priority of the card, with urgent tasks on top (you can use [sort by due date](https://blog.trello.com/7-ways-to-track-tasks-in-trello)). Don't forget to [archive tasks](http://help.trello.com/article/786-archiving-lists-deleting-lists) that are done or abandoned.

- Use cards to track meetings. You can use the card description to post the meeting's agenda and the comment section to register minutes during the meeting.

### Slack

We use [Slack](http://yalecs.slack.com) to communicate online. __Quick, efficient communication is vital for our success, so all of our members are expected to be responsive on it.__ We usually keep at least one channel per team.

> *About Facebook Messenger*  
> Using Messenger for quick contact with a group of members is OK. It's best however that group chats there don't last over a couple of days. When that happens, consider transferring it to Slack.

### File Sharing

We use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQa2lnd3Z0bTg4S3c) to keep all of our documents. We prefer adding documents to our shared folder than sharing it with individual members using their emails, for the sake of both convenience and transparency. Teams usually maintain their own folders, which are recycled at the end of each semester, but not deleted!

### Metrics Sheet

One of the most important documents in our Google Drive folder is our spreadsheet of metrics, which we use to keep track of success across our teams. More on this ahead.

### Mailing list

We use the [ycs-in mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in), hosted by the Yale ITS, for important communications and reminders.

### Calendar

We use an internal Google calendar to keep track of important events. All new members should be given access to it and import into to their calendar apps, such as iCal. _Members must use this calendar to register all of our meetings and events_, as well as external events that we should be aware of.

These external events include:

- events of the academic calendar, like breaks and reading periods
- dates for PSET, midterms and finals for the core Computer Science classes
- events of related organizations on campus, such as YHack and DSAC
