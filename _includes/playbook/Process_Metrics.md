"How many people came to the last event? How many likes did our Facebook post get? What is the average number of visualizations of the newsletter?" These are some of the questions that we ask ourselves on a weekly basis as we try to understand how our teams are doing and how they can improve. We call the answers to these questions our **"metrics" â€“ numbers that help us assess the performance and impact of the work we do**.

### Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet containing all of our metrics [lives in our shared folder and is available to all of our members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLYrQrd-UTvufIzzDQ3Dmyy7skhIQh9CD8W_69eHE_M/edit). Each team has its own tab where they fill in, week after week, their metrics.

Our template tab looks like this:

**Picking the right metrics won't matter unless we commit to following up on them.** That is why we look at them every week during meetings. During board meetings, team managers will bring the latest numbers and discuss them with the rest of the board.

### Health, Execution and Impact

We like to differentiate between three categories of metrics, according to the purpose they serve.

#### Health metrics

> "What is the average rate of absence in our meetings?"  
> "What rate of our members marked themselves 'dissatisfied' with the work we do?"  
> "How many people attended our retreat?"

_Mens sana in corpore sano_. Only a healthy team can keep doing amazing work in the long run. That's why we have metrics to try to measure how well we are working together over time.

**Health metrics are at the same time the most important ones and the trickiest to measure.**

#### Execution metrics

> "How many speakers did we reach out to?"  
> "How many events did we organize this semester?"  

These questions help us track the work we accomplish to do in objective ways. Execution tasks act as follow up to delegated work.

#### Impact metrics

> "How many responded to our Facebook event?"  
> "What is the view rate of our last newsletter?"  
> "How many students said 'very important' when surveyed about YCS's importance?"

Impact metrics help us assess the impact of our projects. Some projects, especially events, can only measure their impact _after_ they finish.
