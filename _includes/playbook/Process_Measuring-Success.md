In order to succeed, we must be able to tell our successes from our failures. That is why we keep track

These numbers are called our **metrics**.

As much as we can, we use data to.

### Internal Metrics

Internal metrics keep track of a team's performance.

### External Metrics

External metrics keep track of a team's success.
