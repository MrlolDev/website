We organize the work we do in three categories, which we call "tracks". The tasks related to logistics of organizing events (eg. finding a space, providing food) belong to the `events track`. The ones related to talking to students, teachers and staff (eg. writing our newsletter, making suggestions to the department) are in the `community track`. Tasks related to talking to third-parties (eg. inviting speakers or bringing recruiters to campus) belong to the `partnerships track`. Each of our members specializes in a track, according to our skills and aspirations, and that track determines our responsibilities.

Our `teams` are groups of members working on a certain project. Each team can have members from multiple tracks, depending on their needs. The team responsible for recruiting events probably needs partnerships people more than anything else. Our newsletter team, however, probably doesn't need events or partnerships work.

We can thus distribute our members in a `matrix of tracks and teams`.

|Teams \ Tracks| Events | Community | Partnerships|
| ------------- |:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Study sessions| 4 | 2 | 0 |
| Recruiting    | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Newsletters   | 0 | 2 | 0 |

Each team is assigned to one or two `team leads`: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report the latest [tasks](#trello) and [metrics](#metrics).

The matrix of tracks and teams is constantly evolving, as our goals and resources change. At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a [postmortem](#postmortem). At the beginning of each semester, the board can decide to continue the team – possibly with different members, goals and leads.
