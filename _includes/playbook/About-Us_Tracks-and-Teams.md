We organize the work we do in three categories, which we call "tracks". Work related to logistics of organizing events (eg. finding a space, providing food) is in the `events track`. Work related to talking to students, teachers and staff (eg. publicizing an event, writing our newsletter, making suggestions to the department) is in the `community track`. Work related to talking to third-parties (eg. inviting speakers, bringing recruiters toÂ campus) is in the `partnerships track`. Each of our members specializes in a track, according to our skills and aspirations. Someone's track determines their responsibilities in the teams they work with.

Our `teams` are groups of members working on a certain project. Each team can have members from multiple tracks, depending on their needs. The team for recruiting events probably needs partnerships people more than anything else. Our newsletter team, however, doesn't need any events or partnerships work.

We can distribute our members in a `matrix of tracks and teams`, like so.

|Teams \ Tracks| Events | Community | Partnerships|
| ------------- |:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Study sessions| 4 | 2 | 0 |
| Recruiting    | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Newsletters   | 0 | 2 | 0 |

Our actual matrix of tracks and teams is constantly evolving, as our goals and resources change. At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a [postmortem](#postmortem). At the beginning of each semester, the board can decide to continue the team, sometimes with different members or goals.

Each team is assigned to one or two `team leads`: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report to their directors the updates on [tasks](#trello) and [metrics](#metrics). Team leads are usually determined by the `predominant track` of their project. For example, in the matrix of tracks and teams above, the team lead of _study sessions_ would probably be someone in events, while the _recruiting sessions_ could also use a team lead in partnerships.
