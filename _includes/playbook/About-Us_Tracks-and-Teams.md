This page describes how we organize our work, dividing people by tracks (ie. what they specialize in) and putting them in teams (ie. groups that work on a certain project).

### Firm example

You may think of our Computer Society as a not-for-profit company. Like firms in a market, we have a product – the several projects we undertake throughout the year – that we promote and "sell" to our different customers – the Computer Science majors, our school administration, tech recruiters etc. Unlike firms, however, all the work we do is _pro bono_: we don't charge students for going to our events, we don't have a payroll and our retirement fund is empty. And we don't have office parties [that suck](https://youtu.be/p6Eaz-1_3iA?t=39s).



This analogy, however fragile, can teach us a lot about .

The challenges of working for student organizations are many.

### Guidelines

- No ambiguous delegation. We don't have co-presidents, co-managers (but we do). For every project, there is a person solely responsible for it.

###

Being a student organization dedicated to several simultaneous projects presents comparable challenges when compared to single-purpouse.

- We operate on a per-semester schedule.

# Tracks

In order to work all of the projects we set out, our organization requires a lot of.

By entering our organization, members have to pick a track to specialize in, which they later change if they want.
