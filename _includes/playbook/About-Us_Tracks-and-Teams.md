We organize the work we do in three categories, which we call "tracks". Work related to logistics of organizing events (eg. finding a space, providing food) belongs to the `events track`. Work related to talking to students, teachers and staff (eg. publicizing an event, writing our newsletter, making suggestions to the department) belongs to the `community track`. Work related to reaching out and working with third-parties (eg. inviting speakers, bringing recruiters toÂ campus) belongs to the `partnerships track`. Each of our members specializes in a track, according to their skills and aspirations. Tracks determines people's main responsibilities in the teams they work with.

Our `teams` are groups of members working on a certain project. Each team may have members from multiple tracks, depending on their needs. A team that organizes recruiting events, for example, probably needs partnerships people more than anything else. The team for the newsletter, however, doesn't need any members in events or partnerships.

We can visualize the allocation of members in a `matrix of tracks and teams`, like so.

|Teams \ Tracks| Events | Community | Partnerships|
| ------------- |:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Study sessions| 4 | 2 | 0 |
| Recruiting    | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Newsletters   | 0 | 2 | 0 |

Our actual matrix of tracks and teams is constantly evolving, as our goals and resources change. __At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a postmortem.__ After the break, the board can decide to continue the team, usually with some different members or goals.

### Team leads

Each team is assigned one or two `team leads`: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team to make progress towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report to their directors the updates on tasks and metrics.

Team leads are usually determined by the `predominant track` of their project. In the matrix of tracks and teams above, for instance, the team lead of _study sessions_ would probably be someone in the _events tracks_, while the _recruiting sessions_ could also use a team lead in in the _partnerships track_.
