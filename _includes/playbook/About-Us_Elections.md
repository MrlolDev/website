ThreeÂ important transitions happen at the end of each semester, no later than the weekend before finals.

In the `vetting of the rookies`, the current board comes together to vet rookies to become official members of our society. The decision is determined by a majority vote by the current directors. Memberships can be denied or deferred, for instance, for rookies who didn't yet demonstrate commitment or ability to work effectively with others.

In the `tapping of the board`, the current board chooses members from outside of the board to become directors. Forms are sent out through which members can express their interest in the position and/or anonymously nominate other members. During deliberation, directors who have worked with each of these members make the case for their experience. The result is determined by a _majority vote by the present directors_. Members tapped may deny the offer to become directors.

During the `petition of the chairs`, members of the newly elected board get together to choose the new chairs. Directors who are petitioning for a chair should make the case for their relevant skills and experience, and show a vision and commitment to the society. Deliberations end only when an absolute majority of the members present support each association in a bijective mapping of chairs to directors. This may take several hours.

Directors can be reelected for the same chair once. Indeed, good chairs should stay for a year. Seniors and rising seniors can't run nor vote.
