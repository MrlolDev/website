ThreeÂ important transitions happen at the end of each semester, no later than the weekend before finals.

In the `vetting of the noobs`, the current board comes together to vet rookies to become official members of our society. The decision is determined by the majority of present directors. Memberships can be denied or deferred, for instance, for rookies who didn't yet demonstrate commitment or ability to work effectively with others.

In the `tapping of the board`, the current board chooses members from outside of the board to become directors. During deliberation, directors who have worked with each of these members make the case for their experience. The result is determined by the _majority of present directors_. Members tapped may deny the offer to become directors.

During the `petition of the chairs`, members of the newly elected board get together to choose the new chairs. Directors who are petitioning for a chair should make the case for their relevant skills and experience, and show commitment and a vision for the society. Deliberations end only when an absolute majority of the members present support each association in a bijective mapping of chairs to directors. This may take several hours. Directors can be reelected for the same chair once. Seniors and rising seniors can't run nor vote.
