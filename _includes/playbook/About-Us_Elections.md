ThreeÂ important transitions happen at the end of each semester, by no later than the weekend of reading period.

During the `vetting of the noobs`, the current board comes together to vet noobs to become official members of our society. The membership decision is determined by the _majority of present directors_. Noobs may be denied, for instance, due to demonstrated _lack of commitment_ or _inability to work in teams_.

In the `tapping of directors`, the current board members chooses ordinary members to become directors and join the board. During deliberation, directors who have worked with each of these members make the case for making them directors. The result is determined by the _majority of present directors_. Members tapped may deny the offer to become directors.

During the `petition of chairs`, members of the newly elected board get together to choose the new chairs. Directors who are petitioning for a chair should make the case for their relevant skills and experience, and show commitment and a vision for the society. Deliberations end only when an absolute majority supports each association in a bijective mapping of chairs to directors. __This takes several hours.__ Seniors and rising seniors can't petition nor vote. Directors can be reelected for the same chair once.
