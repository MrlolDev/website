## Focus on impact*

We are here because we care about our community and we want to see it prosper. The opportunity to serve it inspires us to be creative and work hard. We try to make decisionsÂ that maximize the social value that we deliver to the world.

## Always be learning

We see each new day as an opportunity for personal and professional growth. We explore, we question, and we listen. We welcome feedback from our peers and we offer them our feedback in goodwill.

## Leadership is ownership

As leaders, we own the outcome of our projects, good or bad. We voice our concerns whenever we see problems and we step up to fix things. We know to ask others for help when we need it and we know to help others when asked.
