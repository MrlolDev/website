## Focus on impact*

We are here because we care about our community and we want to see it prosper. The opportunity to serve inspires us to work hard and to be creative. We always seek to make decisionsÂ that maximize the social value that we deliver to the world.

## Always be learning

We see each new day as an opportunity for personal and professional growth. We analyze, we question, we listen and we weigh in. We welcome feedback from our peers, just as we offer them our own in goodwill.

## Leadership is ownership

As leaders, we own the outcome of our projects, the successes as well as the failures. We voice our concerns whenever we see problems and we step up to fix things. We know to ask others for help when we need it and we know to offer help when others need it.
