## Focus on impact*

We are here for the opportunity to make a big positive impact in our community while working alongside talented and inspiring friends. The opportunity to help inspires us to be creative and work hard. We make decisions that maximize the social value that we deliver.

## Always be learning

We take every interaction as an opportunity for personal and professional growth. We welcome feedback from our peers and we offer feedback on a daily basis. We read, we ask, we listen, we take notes etc. We seek instruction for more senior members and we offer to aid junior members.

## Leadership is ownership

We are leaders and we own up to our responsibilities. We don't bail out on the commitments we make to each other. As leaders, we also **own the outcome of our team**. We step up and voice our concerns when we see problems. **We step up because we care.** We offer to help others with problems they are facing.
