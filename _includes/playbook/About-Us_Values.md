## Focus on impact*

We are here because we care about our community and we want to see it prosper. **The opportunity to help inspires us to work hard and come up with new ways to do so.** We make decisions so as to maximize the social value that we deliver.

## Always be learning

We take our learning very seriously. **We take every interaction as an opportunity for personal and professional growth.** We read, we ask, we listen, we take notes etc. We seek instruction for more senior members and we offer to aid junior members. We welcome feedback from our peers and we offer feedback on a daily basis â€“ discreetly, as soon as we have the chance. **Knowledge and experience is what we get to take home when we become alumni.** It is what sets us apart from the rest of the school.

## Leadership is ownership

We are leaders and we own up to our responsibilities. We don't bail out on the commitments we make to each other. As leaders, we also **own the outcome of our team**. We step up and voice our concerns when we see problems. **We step up because we care.** We offer to help others with problems they are facing.
