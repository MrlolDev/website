Plan and follow up.

We are always working on a multitude of initiatives to help the community we serve, some of which can be quite risky. They might be ventures never successfully accomplished before or projects that require a lot of preliminary investment but which can flop at anytime. Some initiatives might even expose our reputation, making it harder to maintain members and partners. **In order to continue thriving despite these odds, we focus on making the best decisions we can – as quickly as we can – even in face of uncertainty.**

### Guidelines

- No ambiguous delegation. We don't have co-presidents, co-managers (but we do). For every project, there is a person solely responsible for it.
