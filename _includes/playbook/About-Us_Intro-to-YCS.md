Our society exists to serve the community of Yale students interested in Computer Science and Engineering. We work hard to improve the undergraduate experience of these students and to advance the Computer Science department.

###

We are always working on a multitude of initiatives to help the community we serve, some of which can be quite risky. They might be ventures never successfully accomplished before or projects that require a lot of preliminary investment but which can flop at anytime. Some initiatives might even expose our reputation, making it harder to maintain members and partners. **In order to continue thriving despite these odds, we focus on making the best decisions we can – as quickly as we can – even in face of uncertainty.**
