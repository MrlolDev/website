Newcomers in our society are `rookies`. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, rookies have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that mentor them. By the end of the semester, rookies are vetted and become `official members`. By the end in their second semester, members they can be tapped to become `directors` and join our board.

## Mentorship

Our `board of directors` plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director takes a few members of their own track as mentees, usually people spread over just a couple of teams, and follow the work they do, helping them with problems as they come along. Directors must be in constant touch with their mentees, and every other week may join also their meetings. Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their mentees. _Just like teams, mentorships are dissolved at the end of each semester and may be renewed afterwards._

## Chairs

After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become `chairs`. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs are an extra responsibility on top of a director's role of mentoring.

- The `Chairperson` is .

- The `Recruitment` chair is .

- The `Culture` chair is

responsible for our internal newsletter (birthdays, feedback etc).

Birthdays.

- The `Membership` chair is responsible for running the recruitment process and for making sure that the mentorship of directors and members are working.

## Perks of membership

We look for members who truly believe in the importance of our mission and in working under our values. That said, there are several perks available to our rookies and official members, some of which are quite exclusive on campus to our society.
