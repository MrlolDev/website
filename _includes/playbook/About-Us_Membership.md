Newcomers in our society are `rookies`. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, rookies have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that mentor them. By the end of the semester, rookies are vetted and become `official members`. By the end in their second semester, members they can be tapped to become `directors` and join our board. After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become `chairs`.

## Mentorship

Our `board of directors` plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director takes a few members as mentees and follow the work they do, helping them with problems as they come along. The mentees are usually the members of a couple of teams that share the same track as the director. Directors must be in constant touch with their mentees, and may also sit in on their meetings every other week. Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their mentees. _Just like teams, mentorships are dissolved at the end of each semester and may be renewed afterwards._

## Chairs

Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs usually work as mentors to other directors, those with less experience.

- The `Chairperson` is the team lead for the chairs. They are the [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) who makes sure that each of our member has resources to work appropriately, according to the playbook.

- The `Culture` chair is runs social events and traditions of our society. Responsibilities include:
  - __Weekly dinners__
  - __Society toasts__
  - __Weekly newsletter__

- The `Mentorship/Operations` chair makes sure that our members are learning and having fun. Responsibilities include:
  - Onboard people.
  - Setting up the mentorship pairings and make sure they are working.

Chairs usually rely on the help of others to run events.
