Newcomers in our society are `rookies`. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, rookies have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that mentor them. By the end of the semester, rookies are vetted and become `official members`. By the end in their second semester, members they can be tapped to become `directors` and join our board.

## Mentorship

Our `board of directors` plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director takes a few members of their own track as mentees, usually people spread over just a couple of teams, and follow the work they do, helping them with problems as they come along. A Director of Community, for example, may work with two community members doing publicity work for a study session, as well as with the lead of the team that writes the newsletters. Directors must be in constant touch with their members, touching base at least a couple of times per week. _Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their pupils._ __Like teams, mentorships are dissolved at the end of each semester and may be renewed.__

## Chairs

After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become `chairs`. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs are an extra responsibility on top of a director's role of supporting teams.
