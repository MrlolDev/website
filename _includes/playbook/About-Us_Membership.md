Newcomers in our society are `noobs`. Their first year with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, noobs have to pick one of three tracks to specialize in: community, events or partnerships. Their choice of specialization will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that they work with.

By the end of their second semester, noobs are vetted and become our official members, who can be tapped to become `directors` and join our board. Our board of directors plays an important role of support to members in our club. They oversee projects and give support to leads.

Directors can become `chairs` after one semester in the board. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture.
