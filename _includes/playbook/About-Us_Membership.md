Newcomers in our society are `noobs`. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, noobs have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that they work with. By the end of the semester, noobs are vetted and become `official members`.

By the end of their first year, members they can be tapped to become `directors` and join our board. Our `board of directors` plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director helps members of their own track (usually a handful of people spread over a couple of teams) to make progress in their tasks. A Director of Community, for instance, may work with two community members doing publicity work for a study session, as well as with the lead of the team that writes the newsletters. Directors must be in constant touch with their members, touching base at least a couple of times per week. _Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their pupils._

After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become `chairs`. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs are an extra responsibility on top of a director's role of supporting teams.
