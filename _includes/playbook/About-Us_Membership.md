Newcomers in our society are called `rookies`. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. By the end of the semester, rookies are vetted and become `official members`. By the end of their second semester, members can then be tapped to become `directors` and join our board. After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become `chairs`.

## Mentorship

Our `board of directors` plays an important role in supporting our teams. Each director takes a few members as mentees and follows the work they do, helping them with problems as they come along. Directors must be in constant touch with their mentees, and may also sit in on their meetings every other week. Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their mentees. _Just like teams, the board dissolved at the end of each semester and may be renewed afterwards._

## Chairs

Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs usually work as mentors to other directors who have less experience.

- The `Chairperson` is the team lead for the chairs. They are the [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) who makes sure that each of our members has the resources they need to work appropriately, according to the playbook.

- The `Culture` chair runs social events and maintains the traditions of our society. Responsibilities include:
  - __Weekly dinners__
  - __Society toasts__
  - __Weekly newsletter__
  - __Part-ais__
  - Internal study breaks (__Hot coacode__, with hot cocoa, that happens during the winter).

- The `Mentorship/Operations` chair makes sure that our members are learning and having fun. Responsibilities include:
  - Onboarding people.
  - Setting up the mentorship pairings and making sure they are functioning.
  - Following up on mentors and mentees via surveys.
  - Holding workshops for mentors at the beginning of each semester.

- The `Membership` chair is responsible for
  - Finding ways to make YCS the most satisfied club on campus.
  - Mentor or lead the team for the Fall Extracurricular Bazaar and the Spring Bulldog Days.
  - Publicize YCS throughout the entire semester.

- The `Treasurer` is responsible for managing our monetary assets.

Chairs usually rely on the help of others to run events.

## Perks of membership

We look for members who truly believe in the importance of our mission and in working under our values. That said, there are several perks available to our rookies and official members, some of which are quite exclusive to our society.

- _Resume books for big tech companies_
- _Trips to NYC?_
- _Team swag_
