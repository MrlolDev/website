At the beginning of each semester, we must distribute work.

1. Two weeks before the beginning of the semester, the board convenes virtually to pick the projects we can work on each semester and rank them in importance. Directors are then distributed by project.

2. After that meeting, directors start interviewing team leads for their teams.

3. In the first week of school, the board convenes to share notes on interviews and to finalize the project lead distribution.

4. In first general meeting, members vote on the couple of projects they would like to work on.
