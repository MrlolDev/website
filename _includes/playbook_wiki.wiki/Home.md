Welcome to the Yale Computer Society's Playbook. This document is a compilation of the knowledge acquired over generations of our leadership teams on how to lead an effective computer society at Yale.

~It is the duty of all of our members to follow the norms and processes outlined here, proposing changes whenever they see an opportunity for improvement. This is also an attempt to solidify what works and question what doesn't work.~
