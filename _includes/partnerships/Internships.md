# Braintree Software Engineering Internship

### Chicago or SF
The internship (10 weeks, summer 2018) will have you working on a part of our system: open sourcing core elements, developing business-critical operations tools, or prototyping new features. Throughout the summer you will pair program on production teams where you will learn from and teach your teammates and practice test-driven development to create high-quality, maintainable software. The code you write will contribute to our codebase and actually be deployed into production.

# ModiPhit - Fitness StartUp

### New Haven
My name is Jemir Martinez and I’m the CEO/Founder of ModiPhit, a fitness startup in Stamford, Connecticut. I’m developing a machine learning mobile application and I’m looking for a
student intern at Yale University from the computer science department. Being that Yale’s computer science program is ranked in the top 10 of the country I know you have extraordinarily talent.
Initially the opportunity will be a paid internship then it will have the
possibility of being long-term involvement.

# Frog Tutoring

### New Haven
We are a tutoring company and we are starting to see a significant boom in
clientele in New Haven. Unfortunately, we don't quite have the numbers to
meet the demand. We currently have several Yale University students who are in desperate
need of tutors this fall! Could you help us out? We are looking for
students within your Department that are passionate and knowledgeable about
teaching and learning.

# Facebook University

### Menlo Park, CA
We’d call it “hands-on” but it’s so much more than that. Facebook University is an immersive program into both our people and our products and services. The internship offers experience across engineering and business roles to rising college students in underrepresented communities. In just 8 short weeks, the things you build as a FBU intern can redefine the way the world connects.
