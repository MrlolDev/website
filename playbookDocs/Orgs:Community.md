### -  YCS Prize

Semester-long competition for the best CS-related side projects at Yale. Event is designed to encourage exploration and practical application of CS areas not covered by theoretical focus of academic curriculum (e.g mobile/web development, VR/AR, etc.) through addressing key issues: increasing incentive via promise of monetary compensation, and reducing friction (hopefully) through mentorship for novice teams and ‘starter packs’ (collection of useful resources for beginners).

Coordinate with recruiters on campus to bring companies to present to students. **Give students heads up about selective recruiting opportunities (this is super important I feel).**


* Hackathons

Listing which hackathons Yale students are going to. Keeping track of deadlines  and application results. Campaigning so that students sign up for the good ones (use mailing list, facebook, …?). Setting up groups for students without them and supporting students during these hackathons. (perhaps Yale t-shirts?) Keep track of stats around students attending hackathons. **Taking people to hackathons on a bus**** (https://www.sharethebus.com/).**

* Survey & Reports

Publish end of semester reports on the state of Computer Science.

    * Share upcoming opportunities in CS at Yale, or for Yale students.

    * Share about successful Yale alumni and cool events that happened on campus.

    * Reach out to organizations and get them to promote our events on their mailing lists

    * Reach out to press (most likely YDN, Yale Entrepreneurial Magazine, New Haven Register) and get them to cover our event and/or give pre-event publicity
