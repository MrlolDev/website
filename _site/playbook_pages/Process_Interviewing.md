In most cases, the board will be opening an application form a couple of weeks before each semester, closing it after the first week of class. After that date the board should sit together to review and discuss  the applicants' responses. They should begin by selecting the students who seem aligned with YCS’ values and its current composition, and then proceed to distribute adequate applicants into each of our teams. The distribution should be based on the students’ demonstrated interests, skills and commitment, and how those are likely to fit into each team. After this triage, each director will be responsible for interviewing in person their respective applicants. The rest of the board should be let known, probably via a spreadsheet, of when each of the interviews will be happening, so they can sit in and help.

In the special case that the board fails to distribute a qualified person into a specific team, it is up for the p/vp to interview them.

If, in conducting an interview, a director thinks the student they’re interviewing would rather fit in another group, they should finish the interview by trying to assess fit to this other team.

## Scheduling interviews

To schedule interviews, you should create an online form that students can use to sign up for interview slots. We recommend using [doodle.com](http://doodle.com/) – make sure to double-check that applicants can select the right times. Keep in mind the number of students you have to interview and be prepared to have to reschedule due to conflicts of some of them.

After creating the signup form for interviews, you should email them. It is a good idea to send personalized emails where you greet them by their first names (NOTE:  You can use a mail merge system to accomplish that. Nylas has that built in.) and thank them for applying. We really want new members to know that we care. Make sure you also introduce yourself and let them know that **you** personally selected them as a good candidate for whatever team you’re on.

## Conducting interviews

While the interviews will be mostly conducted at the discretion of the director in charge, a few things are strongly advised.

First of all, understand that the interview depends much more on you than on the person you will be interviewing, so **make sure to prepare** accordingly. Make sure you re-read the applicant’s responses and the observations made by you and the rest of the board during the triage. Interview questions should be tailored to asking follow-ups to their written application and understanding more about their fit to the club, considering fit/ambition, commitment and skills (NOTE:  Probably in that order.).

**Make sure you schedule consecutive slots of around 40 minutes**, so you can interview for 30 to 35 minutes and then breathe and prepare for at least five. Do make sure you have time to pee and drink water in between candidates.

**Take as many notes as you can.** After the interview process is over, you will likely have to come back and compare candidates and that won’t be an easy task. You will be glad you have notes to read. Taking notes on candidates’ responses will help you remember who is who, and even ask someone who didn’t sit on the interviews for help evaluating a candidate. Keep in mind that note taking is a skill that takes practice. Here are a few resources on this.

Finally, **make sure candidates can commit to the club**. If they are taking hard classes that semester and very involved in other extracurricular commitments, maybe you should suggest that they defer their application by a semester. Many of us can go through an entire application process before actually considering whether we will have the time to put into that activity. It is **your responsibility to convey to them the expectation that are implied in the positions they are about to sign up for**. This, of course, will depend on the team they are interviewing for. Candidates should also be available to attend our general meetings every week (now at 8pm on Sundays) – very few exceptions should be made for this.

## Bank of questions with commentary

Here is a bank of questions you can draw from, with commentary. They are separated into the traits they test for, between **fit/ambition**, **commitment** and **skill**.

### Fit/ambition

The purpose of these is to gauge if the applicant is aligned with YCS’ mission of working hard to improve the tech community at Yale.

* Why do you want to be part of our team?

* One of our biggest challenges is to

* What is one thing you wish existed at Yale to?

* What are some things you think are lacking with computer science at Yale?

* What are some ideas you have for improving CS at Yale?

* Could you describe briefly what steps you would take to execute one of those ideas?

* What got you interested in CS/technology?

### Commitment

You want to make sure that the student can commit.

* What are your other extracurricular commitments this semester?

* Are you free to attend our general meetings?

### Skill

The skills you want to check for vary from team to team.

* Tell me more about your experience doing X in high school.
