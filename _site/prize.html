	<h3>The <strong>Yale Computer Society</strong> presents the</h3>
	<h1>Grace Hopper Prize</h1>
	<h2>$1100 in prizes for the best software projects, sponsored by
		<strong><a href="http://www.yaletech.org">Yale Tech</a></strong>, <strong>Yale Computer Science Department</strong>,
		and <strong>Eric Ries (Y '00)</strong>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Want to build something awesome? Want to create something impressive for your resume? Want a chance at a $1000 prize pool?
	</p>
	<p>
		Submit a project to the YCS' first annual <strong>Grace Hopper Prize</strong>. Projects will be judged by our esteemed panel of Yale alumni entrepreneurs and Yale Computer Science professors with projects evaluated based upon their technological ingenuity, grace of design, completion, and level of difficulty. Along with the overarching prize, we will also have the <strong>Alan Perlis Prize for Newcomers</strong> for students currently enrolled in CPSC 223 or below. These prizes are designed to promote creativity and consistent effort on projects outside of the classroom during the course of this Spring 2017 semester.

		<h1>Competition rules</h1>
	</header>

	<ul>
		<li>The group must be entirely composed of current Yale students.</li>
		<li>To qualify for the Alan Perlis Prize for Newcomers, none of your members can have completed CPSC 223 or 323.</li>
		<li>Groups may not exceed 5 people (you do not need to work in a group).</li>
		<li>Each participant may only submit one project.</li>
		<li>Projects must have been started after October 31, 2016. Projects started for classes (such as CS50) will be accepted, but further work on them is suggested. Only hackathon projects created during the spring semester of 2017 are allowed.</li>
		<li>Projects must be software based. If you would like to include a hardware component please contact <a href="mailto:cristobal.gonzalez@yale.edu">cristobal.gonzalez@yale.edu</a>.</li>
		<li>If interested, sign up here for important updates! We’re going to have hack nights where teams can get together to work on their projects, look at what other teams are working on, eat free food, and attend workshops taught by fellow undergrads (e.g. web development, mobile development). </li>
	</ul>

<section class="prize-judging">
	<header>
		<h1>Judging criteria</h1>
	</header>
	<ul>
		<li>Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?</li>
		<li>Design: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).</li>
		<li>Completion: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?</li>
		<li>Each criteria will be weighted equally and scored on a 1-5 scale.</li>
	</ul>
