<p>Our society exists to serve the community of Yale students interested in Computer Science and Engineering. We work hard to improve the undergraduate experience of these students and to advance the Computer Science department.</p>

<h3 id="section">???</h3>

<p>We are always working on a multitude of initiatives to help the community we serve, some of which can be quite risky. They might be ventures never successfully accomplished before or projects that require a lot of preliminary investment but which can flop at anytime. Some initiatives might even expose our reputation, making it harder to maintain members and partners. <strong>In order to continue thriving despite these odds, we focus on making the best decisions we can – as quickly as we can – even in face of uncertainty.</strong></p>

			<p>Our society is designed to accommodate members with different levels of availability and skill. In this</p>

<p>Two main levels of leadership exist. The <strong>senior board</strong> is composed of the President, the Vice-President, the Social Chair and the Treasurer. The <strong>board of directors</strong> is composed of the directors in charge of each of our three teams: Partnerships, Community and Events.</p>

<h3 id="board-of-directors">Board of Directors</h3>

<p>The board of directors is composed of the members of the senior board as well as of the directors of each of our three teams (<strong>Events</strong>, <strong>Community</strong>, <strong>Partnerships</strong>). While each director must be assigned to a single team, each team can be assigned to multiple directors, ideally a pair. When teams have multiple directors, the work must be clearly divided between them. In this case each must have direct control over specific people, projects and metrics.</p>

<p>Directors of different teams have different responsibilities, as worked out with the rest of the senior board.</p>

<h3 id="firm-example">Firm example</h3>

<p>You may think of our Computer Society as a not-for-profit company. Like firms in a market, we have a product – the several projects we undertake throughout the year – that we promote and “sell” to our different customers – the Computer Science majors, our school administration, tech recruiters etc. Unlike firms, however, all the work we do is <em>pro bono</em>: we don’t charge students for going to our events, we don’t have a payroll and our retirement fund is empty. And we don’t have office parties <a href="https://youtu.be/p6Eaz-1_3iA?t=39s">that suck</a>.</p>

<p>This analogy, however fragile, can teach us a lot about .</p>

<p>The challenges of working for student organizations are many.</p>

			<p>In most cases, the board will be opening an application form a couple of weeks before each semester, closing it after the first week of class. After that date the board should sit together to review and discuss  the applicants’ responses. They should begin by selecting the students who seem aligned with YCS’ values and its current composition, and then proceed to distribute adequate applicants into each of our teams. The distribution should be based on the students’ demonstrated interests, skills and commitment, and how those are likely to fit into each team. After this triage, each director will be responsible for interviewing in person their respective applicants. The rest of the board should be let known, probably via a spreadsheet, of when each of the interviews will be happening, so they can sit in and help.</p>

<p>In the special case that the board fails to distribute a qualified person into a specific team, it is up for the p/vp to interview them.</p>

<p>If, in conducting an interview, a director thinks the student they’re interviewing would rather fit in another group, they should finish the interview by trying to assess fit to this other team.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-interviews">Scheduling interviews</h2>

<p>To schedule interviews, you should create an online form that students can use to sign up for interview slots. We recommend using <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle.com</a> – make sure to double-check that applicants can select the right times. Keep in mind the number of students you have to interview and be prepared to have to reschedule due to conflicts of some of them.</p>

<p>After creating the signup form for interviews, you should email them. It is a good idea to send personalized emails where you greet them by their first names (NOTE:  You can use a mail merge system to accomplish that. Nylas has that built in.) and thank them for applying. We really want new members to know that we care. Make sure you also introduce yourself and let them know that <strong>you</strong> personally selected them as a good candidate for whatever team you’re on.</p>

<h2 id="conducting-interviews">Conducting interviews</h2>

<p>While the interviews will be mostly conducted at the discretion of the director in charge, a few things are strongly advised.</p>

<p>First of all, understand that the interview depends much more on you than on the person you will be interviewing, so <strong>make sure to prepare</strong> accordingly. Make sure you re-read the applicant’s responses and the observations made by you and the rest of the board during the triage. Interview questions should be tailored to asking follow-ups to their written application and understanding more about their fit to the club, considering fit/ambition, commitment and skills (NOTE:  Probably in that order.).</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you schedule consecutive slots of around 40 minutes</strong>, so you can interview for 30 to 35 minutes and then breathe and prepare for at least five. Do make sure you have time to pee and drink water in between candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Take as many notes as you can.</strong> After the interview process is over, you will likely have to come back and compare candidates and that won’t be an easy task. You will be glad you have notes to read. Taking notes on candidates’ responses will help you remember who is who, and even ask someone who didn’t sit on the interviews for help evaluating a candidate. Keep in mind that note taking is a skill that takes practice. Here are a few resources on this.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>make sure candidates can commit to the club</strong>. If they are taking hard classes that semester and very involved in other extracurricular commitments, maybe you should suggest that they defer their application by a semester. Many of us can go through an entire application process before actually considering whether we will have the time to put into that activity. It is <strong>your responsibility to convey to them the expectation that are implied in the positions they are about to sign up for</strong>. This, of course, will depend on the team they are interviewing for. Candidates should also be available to attend our general meetings every week (now at 8pm on Sundays) – very few exceptions should be made for this.</p>

<h2 id="bank-of-questions-with-commentary">Bank of questions with commentary</h2>

<p>Here is a bank of questions you can draw from, with commentary. They are separated into the traits they test for, between <strong>fit/ambition</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong> and <strong>skill</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="fitambition">Fit/ambition</h3>

<p>The purpose of these is to gauge if the applicant is aligned with YCS’ mission of working hard to improve the tech community at Yale.</p>

		</header>
		<div class="body markdown-body">
			
			<p>“How many people came to the last event? How many likes did our Facebook post get? What is the average number of visualizations of the newsletter?” These are some of the questions that we ask ourselves on a weekly basis as we try to understand how our teams are doing and how they can improve. We call the answers to these questions our <strong>“metrics” – numbers that help us assess the performance and impact of the work we do</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how we use metrics in a couple of our projects.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-measure-a-subjective-goal">Metrics measure a subjective goal</h3>

<p>Our newsletter team is responsible for sending out weekly emails that inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. Here are some questions they ask themselves ever so often:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In what day of the week should we send the newsletter?”<br />
“Do we need to improve the current design of emails?”<br />
“Should we change the email subject lines to make them clearer?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In making decisions like these, we must try to frame what we hope to accomplish in terms of relevant metrics.</strong> In the case of the newsletter, we want to increase the number of subscribers, the rate of visualizations per email, the average clicks that a certain link gets etc. <strong>That is because we believe that these indicators are correlated with our underlying goal</strong>, which, as said before, is to inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. We use these metrics before it is impossible to measure directly how much we inform and excite students. So if a new format of subject lines increases the number of clicks, it tells us that engagement has probably gone up, so the newsletter team should probably use it. If a new design does the opposite, engagement has probably decreased; the team might want to roll it back.</p>

<p>The email tool used by the newsletter team (ie. MailChimp) should take care of providing the most important statistics for them. But tracking success is not always that easy. Some teams might need to sweat a bit to collect their data.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-can-be-tricky">Metrics can be tricky</h3>

<p><strong>Measuring is not always a straightforward task.</strong> More often than not, it requires the special effort of teams to track attendance, survey students, write down page stats from Facebook etc. Take, for example, the team responsible for hosting our study sessions. What metrics can they use to measure the success of their events? An obvious place to start would be to count the number of attendees – say, by having a volunteer count the number of students who walk into the room. This metric should certainly correlate with the success of our event, right? Yes, but not always! What happens, for instance, when during a particularly underfunded season our study session team is not able to provide food for the participants? We might find that a lot of the people show up to find no cookies and… tip-toe out of the room less than five minutes later. In this case, the number of attendees in itself no longer paints an accurate picture of how the event went, does it?</p>

<p>Here you might be thinking that what we actually want to measure is the total student-hours spent inside that room. <em>But who’s going to volunteer to measure that?!</em> What seems, in theory, like a better metric might be impractical to measure. <strong>If something is too hard to measure, it’s of no use to us.</strong></p>

<p>There is no silver lining here: measuring is very tricky sometimes. <strong>It is up to the individual teams to define what metrics they will use to define success and, if necessary, change to better suit the situations.</strong></p>

<p>Every now and then, the newsletter team will meet to reevaluate the metrics they use and, in terms those metrics, determine what they want to achieve in what period of time. Let’s see how this process works.</p>

<h1 id="metrics-at-ycs">Metrics at YCS</h1>

<p>The spreadsheet containing all of our metrics <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLYrQrd-UTvufIzzDQ3Dmyy7skhIQh9CD8W_69eHE_M/edit">lives in our shared folder and is available to all of our members</a>. Each team has its own tab where they fill in, week after week, their metrics.</p>

<p>Our template tab looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZG89ZP.png?1" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Picking the right metrics won’t matter unless we commit to following up on them.</strong> That is why we look at them every week during meetings. During board meetings, team managers will bring the latest numbers and discuss them with the rest of the board.</p>

<h3 id="health-execution-and-impact">Health, Execution and Impact</h3>

<p>We like to differentiate between three categories of metrics, according to the purpose they serve.</p>

<h4 id="health-metrics">Health metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What is the average rate of absence in our meetings?”<br />
“What rate of our members marked themselves ‘dissatisfied’ with the work we do?”
“How many people attended our retreat?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>. Only a healthy team can keep doing amazing work in the long run. That’s why we have metrics to try to measure how well we are working together over time.</p>

<p><strong>Health metrics are at the same time the most important ones and the trickiest to measure.</strong></p>

<h4 id="execution-metrics">Execution metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many speakers did we reach out to?”<br />
“How many events did we organize this semester?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions help us track the work we accomplish to do in objective ways. Execution tasks act as follow up to delegated work.</p>

<h4 id="impact-metrics">Impact metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many responded to our Facebook event?”<br />
“What is the view rate of our last newsletter?”<br />
“How many students said ‘very important’ when surveyed about YCS’s importance?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impact metrics help us assess the impact of our projects. Some projects, especially events, can only measure their impact <em>after</em> they finish.</p>

<p>While there is usually little challenge in executing the tasks outlined here, the cost of not doing them can be high. Members may skip important meetings when they aren’t added the internal calendar, they can miss out on important discussions when they can’t check Slack. These situations can be very frustrating to the people involved.</p>

<h3 id="tool-access">Tool access</h3>

<p>Every new member must receive access to the tools described in the <a href="https://github.com/yalecs/playbook/wiki/Process:Tools">Tools page of this playbook</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://yalecompsoc.slack.com"><strong>Slack</strong></a><br />
Managers must add the newbies to the relevant Slack groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href=""><strong>Trello</strong></a><br />
New members must be added to the board and to the YCS Team on Trello.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in"><strong>YCS-IN mailing list</strong></a><br />
New members have to be <strong>added to the YCS Internal elilist</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/render#details_2%7Cdtv-eWFsZS5lZHVfbjNoMWFqcHZ0b2YzdTFmcGI0Z2JhNGEzaG9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ-0-0"><strong>Internal Calendar</strong></a><br />
New members have to be **added to the YCS Internal Google calendar. Only users with permission to manage the calendar can share it with the new students, so make sure to communicate if you aren’t able to add someone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQQmZJdGRJVUZrR00"><strong>Google Drive</strong></a><br />

<h3 id="planning-and-executing">Planning and Executing</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://trello.com/b/npYqD3Ha/ycs-spring-17">Trello board</a> is the source of truth for our organization. We use cards inside our board to distribute work and keep track of everyone’s tasks and deadlines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every member should have a Trello account associated to our board and check it regularly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> in order to communicate with one with one another. We usually have one big channel for each org (e.g. Events) and one channel per team (e.g. Talks). Our domain on Slack is <a href="http://yalecs.slack.com">yalecs.slack.com</a>.</p>

<p>Good communication a crucial quality for any organization. For this reason, it is very important that every one of our members be active on Slack. We strongly recommend installing in your phones and keeping it open in your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Note about Facebook Messenger</strong> 
Using Messenger for ephemeral communications with team members is OK. As a rule of thumb, Messenger groups shouldn’t last more than a couple of days. Once that happens, please consider transferring that group to Slack.</p>

<h4 id="ycs-in-mailing-list">YCS-IN mailing list</h4>

<p>We use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in">ycs-in mailing list</a>, managed by the Yale ITS, for some communications and reminders. Don’t be afraid of using it.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-sheet">Metrics Sheet</h3>

<p>The most important document in our Google Drive folder is our Metric Spreadsheet. It is used to keep track of the progress of our orgs, teams and sometimes of individual members. Managers often must pay special attention to this spreadsheet and update it weekly before meetings. <a href="https://github.com/yalecs/playbook/wiki/Process:Metrics">Learn more about our metrics system.</a></p>

<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>

<p>We use an internal Google calendar associated to yale.edu accounts to coordinate meetings. All new members should be given access to it and add it to their personal calendars.</p>

<h3 id="file-sharing">File Sharing</h3>

<p>We use a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQa2lnd3Z0bTg4S3c">Google Drive folder</a> to keep all of our documents. We prefer adding documents to this Drive folder than sharing it with individual members using their emails. Our society strives for transparency and we trust each other, so there is rarely the need to keep any files relevant to our work outside of this folder.</p>
