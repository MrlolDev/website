	</header>
	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		
<p>We organize the work we do in three categories, which we call “tracks”. Work related to logistics of organizing events (eg. finding a space, providing food) belongs to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">events track</code>. Work related to talking to students, teachers and staff (eg. publicizing an event, writing our newsletter, making suggestions to the department) belongs to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">community track</code>. Work related to reaching out and working with third-parties (eg. inviting speakers, bringing recruiters to campus) belongs to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">partnerships track</code>. Each of our members specializes in a track, according to their skills and aspirations. Tracks determines people’s main responsibilities in the teams they work with.</p>

<p>Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">teams</code> are groups of members working on a certain project. Each team may have members from multiple tracks, depending on their needs. A team that organizes recruiting events, for example, probably needs partnerships people more than anything else. The team for the newsletter, however, doesn’t need any members in events or partnerships.</p>

<p>We can visualize the allocation of members in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">matrix of tracks and teams</code>, like so.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Teams \ Tracks</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Events</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Community</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Partnerships</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Study sessions</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Recruiting</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Newsletters</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Our actual matrix of tracks and teams is constantly evolving, as our goals and resources change. <strong>At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a postmortem.</strong> After the break, the board can decide to continue the team, usually with some different members or goals.</p>

<h3 id="team-leads">Team leads</h3>

<p>Each team is assigned one or two <code class="highlighter-rouge">team leads</code>: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team to make progress towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report to their directors the updates on tasks and metrics.</p>

<p>Team leads are usually determined by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">predominant track</code> of their project. In the matrix of tracks and teams above, for instance, the team lead of <em>study sessions</em> would probably be someone in the <em>events tracks</em>, while the <em>recruiting sessions</em> could also use a team lead in in the <em>partnerships track</em>.</p>

<p>Newcomers in our society are <code class="highlighter-rouge">rookies</code>. Their first semester with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, rookies have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that mentor them. By the end of the semester, rookies are vetted and become <code class="highlighter-rouge">official members</code>. By the end in their second semester, members they can be tapped to become <code class="highlighter-rouge">directors</code> and join our board.</p>

<h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2>

<p>Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">board of directors</code> plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director takes a few members of their own track as mentees, usually people spread over just a couple of teams, and follow the work they do, helping them with problems as they come along. Directors must be in constant touch with their mentees, and every other week may join also their meetings. Directors should advise but can never make decisions for their mentees. <em>Just like teams, mentorships are dissolved at the end of each semester and may be renewed afterwards.</em></p>

<h2 id="chairs">Chairs</h2>

<p>After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become <code class="highlighter-rouge">chairs</code>. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs are an extra responsibility on top of a director’s role of mentoring.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Chairperson</code> is .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Recruitment</code> chair is .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Culture</code> chair is</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>responsible for our internal newsletter (birthdays, feedback etc).</p>

<p>Birthdays.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Membership</code> chair is responsible for running the recruitment process and for making sure that the mentorship of directors and members are working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Treasurer</code> is.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="perks-of-membership">Perks of membership</h2>

<p>We look for members who truly believe in the importance of our mission and in working under our values. That said, there are several perks available to our rookies and official members, some of which are quite exclusive on campus to our society.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Resume books for big tech companies</em></li>
  <li><em>Trips to NYC?</em></li>
  <li><em>Team swag</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Three important transitions happen at the end of each semester, no later than the weekend before finals.</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vetting of the noobs</code>, the current board comes together to vet rookies to become official members of our society. The decision is determined by the majority of present directors. Memberships can be denied or deferred, for instance, for rookies who didn’t yet demonstrate commitment or ability to work effectively with others.</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tapping of the board</code>, the current board chooses members from outside of the board to become directors. During deliberation, directors who have worked with each of these members make the case for their experience. The result is determined by the <em>majority of present directors</em>. Members tapped may deny the offer to become directors.</p>

<p>During the <code class="highlighter-rouge">petition of the chairs</code>, members of the newly elected board get together to choose the new chairs. Directors who are petitioning for a chair should make the case for their relevant skills and experience, and show commitment and a vision for the society. Deliberations end only when an absolute majority of the members present support each association in a bijective mapping of chairs to directors. This may take several hours.</p>

<p>Directors can be reelected for the same chair once. Indeed, good chairs should be <em>asked</em> to stay for a year. Seniors and rising seniors can’t run nor vote.</p>

<h3 id="trello">Trello</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://trello.com/yalecomputersociety">board on Trello</a> is our single source of truth. <em>We use it to plan, delegate and follow up on all of our tasks.</em> Each team owns a column in our board where they keep their own cards. <strong>Team leads must make sure that their columns reflect the current state of the team and that the members are updating them on a daily basis.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>See more about how Trello works <a href="https://trello.com/guide">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.trello.com/topic/trello-news">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some best practices that we follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="http://help.trello.com/article/807-adding-a-member-to-a-card">members feature</a> to delegate a task to someone. You can also <a href="https://blog.trello.com/mark-a-trello-card-as-done">add a due date</a> and make it easier to know when to follow up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep columns ordered by priority of the card, with urgent tasks on top (you can use <a href="https://blog.trello.com/7-ways-to-track-tasks-in-trello">sort by due date</a>). Don’t forget to <a href="http://help.trello.com/article/786-archiving-lists-deleting-lists">archive tasks</a> that are done or abandoned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use cards to track meetings. You can use the card description to post the meeting’s agenda and the comment section to register minutes during the meeting.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="slack">Slack</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://yalecs.slack.com">Slack</a> to communicate online. <strong>Quick, efficient communication is vital for our success, so all of our members are expected to be responsive on it.</strong> We usually keep at least one channel per team.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>About Facebook Messenger</em><br />
Using Messenger for quick contact with a group of members is OK. It’s best however that group chats there don’t last over a couple of days. When that happens, consider transferring it to Slack.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="file-sharing">File Sharing</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQa2lnd3Z0bTg4S3c">Google Drive</a> to keep all of our documents. We prefer adding documents to our shared folder than sharing it with individual members using their emails, for the sake of both convenience and transparency. Teams usually maintain their own folders, which are recycled at the end of each semester, but not deleted!</p>

<h3 id="metrics-sheet">Metrics Sheet</h3>

<p>One of the most important documents in our Google Drive folder is our spreadsheet of metrics, which we use to keep track of success across our teams. More on this ahead.</p>

<h3 id="mailing-list">Mailing list</h3>

<p>We use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in">ycs-in mailing list</a>, hosted by the Yale ITS, for important communications and reminders.</p>

<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>

<p>We use an internal Google calendar to keep track of important events. All new members should be given access to it and import into to their calendar apps, such as iCal. <em>Members must use this calendar to register all of our meetings and events</em>, as well as external events that we should be aware of.</p>

<p>These external events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>events of the academic calendar, like breaks and reading periods</li>
  <li>dates for PSET, midterms and finals for the core Computer Science classes</li>
  <li>events of related organizations on campus, such as YHack and DSAC</li>
</ul>

		<p>If you were part of an extracurricular organization before, chances are that you have mixed feelings about meetings. Often times, meetings can be ineffective time sink that busy college students just can’t afford. <strong>In our club, however, we find that they are the main reason why we are able to get work done, despite our busy schedules.</strong> That is because we use meetings to enforce accountability, drive teams to confront their issues and to make progress.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h1 id="our-meetings">Our Meetings</h1>

<p>Our typical member will attend two one-hour meetings per week.</p>

<h2 id="sunday-night-live">Sunday Night Live</h2>

<p>Every Sunday at 8pm, during the course of the academic year, we all get together to share updates, discuss problems and socialize. The meetings last no longer than one hour, though members often stick around after that to talk in smaller groups. <strong>Our chairs take turns in hosting each week.</strong></p>

<p>Here is how the SNL usually goes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Around 15 minutes before, people start to come in, take a seat and chat.</li>
  <li>The host starts the meeting on time with a summary of the events from the past week.</li>
  <li>The host invites directors to make important announcements.</li>
  <li>After that, the team leads take turns announcing their teams’ latest updates.</li>
  <li>The meeting ends and people disperse into groups to chat about work in the upcoming week.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="engaging-the-room">Engaging the room</h3>

<p>A big challenge for hosts is keeping the mood up in the room. We encourage everyone to interrupt the speakers with observations, ask questions, make jokes etc. It is important that people making announcements stand up in the front and <strong>engage the room</strong>. The host, however, must also keep in mind the clock, making the speakers hurry when necessary.</p>

<p>Here are some good practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play music in the room before the meeting starts and keep it in the background afterwards. While i’s easier for the host to have someone else be the DJ, the hosts can still pick the songs and perhaps start the SNL by describing what is playing.</li>
  <li>Start with a loud, energetic welcome to keep the mood up, and encourage people to clap.</li>
  <li>Ask that people put away their computers and cellphones.</li>
  <li>Have people come forward to share a cool story about the impact of our work.</li>
  <li>Use the projector to show photos from the latest event, music videos, songs playing on the background etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="board-meetings">Board meetings</h2>

<p>Board meetings happen every Wednesday night, from 8pm to 10pm. That is when all team leads and directors come together to discuss progress and issues. Before the board meeting, team leads must update their metrics on the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a big, loud mess.</strong> Good luck. (Srsly, though, we’re gonna figure it out, John.)</p>

<h2 id="team-meetings">Team meetings</h2>

<p>Team meetings vary a lot in format and duration and content, which are all up to the team to collectively decide. They must, however, have fixed meeting times and occur weekly. All meetings should be on the calendar.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-hosts">Tips for hosts</h3>

<p>Every meeting has exactly one host, which is rotated when there are multiple team leads.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do your homework</strong>.<br />
This is rule zero of hosting. Make sure you thought about what will be discussed/accomplish, keeping in mind the time available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ask for attention</strong>.<br />
It’s OK to ask people to lower their laptop lids, or get off their cellphones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Start on time, end on time</strong>.<br />
Meeting times are fixed, so everyone should be expected to arrive on time. You, however, have to make sure to end on time.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tips-for-everyone">Tips for everyone</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be lazy: talk, don’t work</strong><br />
This can vary from team to team, but it’s usually a good idea to use the meeting slot strictly to discuss and plan, not to do work. We often realize during meetings that we forgot to do something important and we rush to do it immediately. But by completing tasks during meetings, however relevant, we usually throw ourselves off the important discussion going on, or, even worse, sometimes bring the discussion to a halt, as others are waiting for us to finish.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lean in</strong><br />
Share your views and don’t hesitate to raise issues when you see them. Leadership is ownership, so you have a responsibility to speak up when you disagree.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="on-absences">On absences</h3>

<p>Absences in meetings come back to bite us in ways we can never foresee. That’s why presence in meetings is so important. Being on time is also very important. Once a couple of people start coming in late, it takes effort and awkwardness to get everybody to show up in time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a nutshell, it is <em>not OK to miss meetings for reasons that you can plan around</em>. That includes doing school work, attending office hours, etc. It does not include, however, being sick or being out of New Haven for a competition. <em>As soon as you know you will miss a meeting, let the chairman know.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Absences in team meetings are taken case-by-case depending on the team lead.</p>

	</header>
	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		<blockquote>
  <p>How many people came to the last event?<br />
How many likes did our Facebook post get?<br />
What is the average number of visualizations of the newsletter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some of the questions that we ask ourselves every week, as we try to understand how our teams are doing and how they can improve. We call the answers to these questions our <em>“metrics”</em>, numbers that help us assess the performance and impact of the work we do.</p>

<h1 id="more-examples">More examples</h1>

<p>Let’s look at the usage of metrics in some of our teams. Feel free to skip this part if you are already used to the concept.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-measure-an-underlying-goal">Metrics measure an underlying goal</h3>

<p>Our newsletter team is responsible for sending out weekly emails that inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. Here are some questions they ask themselves ever so often:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In what day of the week should we send the newsletter?”<br />
“Do we need to improve the current design of emails?”<br />
“Should we change the email subject lines to make them clearer?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In making decisions like these, we must try to frame what we hope to accomplish in terms of quantifiable measures. In the case of the newsletter, we want to increase the number of subscribers, the rate of visualizations per email, the average clicks that a certain link gets etc. That is because we believe that these indicators are correlated with our underlying goal, which, again, is to inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. It is impossible to measure directly how much we inform and excite students, so we use visualizations and rates of clicks instead. If a new format of subject lines increases the number of visualizations, it tells us that engagement has probably gone up, so the newsletter team should probably use it. If a new design does the opposite, engagement has probably decreased; the team might want to roll it back.</p>

<p>The email tool used by the newsletter team should take care of providing the most important statistics for them. But tracking success is not always easy. Most teams need to sweat a bit to collect their data.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-can-be-tricky">Metrics can be tricky</h3>

<p>Measuring is not always straightforward. It sometimes requires special effort of teams to track attendance, survey students, write down page stats from Facebook etc. Take, for example, the team responsible for hosting our study sessions. What metrics can they use to measure the success of their events? An obvious place to start would be to count the number of attendees — say, by having a volunteer count the number of students who walk into the room. This metric should certainly correlate with the success of our event, right? Yes, but not always! What happens, for instance, when during a particularly underfunded season our study session team is not able to provide food for the participants? We might find that a lot of the people show up to find no cookies and… tip-toe out of the room less than five minutes later. In this case, the number of attendees in itself no longer paints an accurate picture of how the event went, does it?</p>

<p>Here you might be thinking that what we actually want to measure is the total student-hours spent inside that room. But who’s going to volunteer to measure that?! What seems, in theory, like a better metric might be impractical to measure. If something is too hard to measure, it’s of no use to us.</p>

<p>There is no silver lining here: measuring is very tricky sometimes. It is up to the individual teams to define what metrics they will use to define success and, if necessary, change to better suit the situations.</p>

<p>Every now and then, the newsletter team will meet to reevaluate the metrics they use and, in terms those metrics, determine what they want to achieve in what period of time. Let’s see how this process works.</p>

<h1 id="our-metrics">Our Metrics</h1>

<p>The spreadsheet containing all of our metrics <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLYrQrd-UTvufIzzDQ3Dmyy7skhIQh9CD8W_69eHE_M/edit">lives in our shared folder and is available to all of our members</a>. Each team has its own tab where they fill in, week after week, their metrics.</p>

<p>Our template tab looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZG89ZP.png?1" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Picking the right metrics won’t matter unless we commit to following up on them.</strong> That is why we look at them every week during meetings. During board meetings, team leads will bring the latest numbers and discuss them with the rest of the board.</p>

<h3 id="health-execution-and-impact">Health, Execution and Impact</h3>

<p>We like to differentiate between three categories of metrics, according to the purpose they serve.</p>

<h4 id="health-metrics">Health metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What is the average rate of absence in our meetings?”<br />
“What rate of our members marked themselves ‘dissatisfied’ with the work we do?”<br />
“How many people attended our retreat?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>. Only a healthy team can keep doing amazing work in the long run. That’s why we have metrics to try to measure how well we are working together over time. <em>Team health is the most important goal for our club and yet the trickiest to measure.</em></p>

<h4 id="execution-metrics">Execution metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many speakers did we reach out to?”<br />
“How many events did we organize this semester?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions help us track the work we accomplish to do in objective ways. Execution tasks act as follow up to delegated work.</p>

<h4 id="impact-metrics">Impact metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many responded to our Facebook event?”<br />
“What is the view rate of our last newsletter?”<br />
“How many students said ‘very important’ when surveyed about YCS’s importance?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impact metrics help us assess the impact of our projects. Some projects, especially events, can only measure their impact <em>after</em> they finish.</p>

	</header>
	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		<p>The chairman opens the application form no later than a couple of weeks before the semester starts, closing it after the first couple of weeks of class. After that date the board should sit together to review and discuss the applicants’ responses. They should begin by selecting the students who seem aligned with YCS’ values and its current composition, and then proceed to distribute adequate applicants into each of our teams. The distribution should be based on the students’ demonstrated interests, skills and commitment, and how those are likely to fit into each team. After this triage, each director will be responsible for interviewing in person their respective applicants. The rest of the board should be let known, probably via a spreadsheet, of when each of the interviews will be happening, so they can sit in and help.</p>

<p>In the special case that the board fails to distribute a qualified person into a specific team, it is up for the p/vp to interview them.</p>

<p>If, in conducting an interview, a director thinks the student they’re interviewing would rather fit in another group, they should finish the interview by trying to assess fit to this other team.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-interviews">Scheduling interviews</h2>

<p>To schedule interviews, you should create an online form that students can use to sign up for interview slots. We recommend using <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle.com</a> – make sure to double-check that applicants can select the right times. Keep in mind the number of students you have to interview and be prepared to have to reschedule due to conflicts of some of them.</p>

<p>After creating the signup form for interviews, you should email them. It is a good idea to send personalized emails where you greet them by their first names (NOTE:  You can use a mail merge system to accomplish that. Nylas has that built in.) and thank them for applying. We really want new members to know that we care. Make sure you also introduce yourself and let them know that <strong>you</strong> personally selected them as a good candidate for whatever team you’re on.</p>

<h2 id="conducting-interviews">Conducting interviews</h2>

<p>While the interviews will be mostly conducted at the discretion of the director in charge, a few things are strongly advised.</p>

<p>First of all, understand that the interview depends much more on you than on the person you will be interviewing, so <strong>make sure to prepare</strong> accordingly. Make sure you re-read the applicant’s responses and the observations made by you and the rest of the board during the triage. Interview questions should be tailored to asking follow-ups to their written application and understanding more about their fit to the club, considering fit/ambition, commitment and skills (NOTE:  Probably in that order.).</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you schedule consecutive slots of around 40 minutes</strong>, so you can interview for 30 to 35 minutes and then breathe and prepare for at least five. Do make sure you have time to pee and drink water in between candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Take as many notes as you can.</strong> After the interview process is over, you will likely have to come back and compare candidates and that won’t be an easy task. You will be glad you have notes to read. Taking notes on candidates’ responses will help you remember who is who, and even ask someone who didn’t sit on the interviews for help evaluating a candidate. Keep in mind that note taking is a skill that takes practice. Here are a few resources on this.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>make sure candidates can commit to the club</strong>. If they are taking hard classes that semester and very involved in other extracurricular commitments, maybe you should suggest that they defer their application by a semester. Many of us can go through an entire application process before actually considering whether we will have the time to put into that activity. It is <strong>your responsibility to convey to them the expectation that are implied in the positions they are about to sign up for</strong>. This, of course, will depend on the team they are interviewing for. Candidates should also be available to attend our general meetings every week (now at 8pm on Sundays) – very few exceptions should be made for this.</p>

<h2 id="bank-of-questions-with-commentary">Bank of questions with commentary</h2>

<p>Here is a bank of questions you can draw from, with commentary. They are separated into the traits they test for, between <strong>fit/ambition</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong> and <strong>skill</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="fitambition">Fit/ambition</h3>

<p>The purpose of these is to gauge if the applicant is aligned with YCS’ mission of working hard to improve the tech community at Yale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why do you want to be part of our team?</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    <p>What is one thing you wish existed at Yale to?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some things you think are lacking with computer science at Yale?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some ideas you have for improving CS at Yale?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you describe briefly what steps you would take to execute one of those ideas?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What got you interested in CS/technology?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment</h3>

<p>You want to make sure that the student can commit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are your other extracurricular commitments this semester?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you free to attend our general meetings?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="skill">Skill</h3>

<p>The skills you want to check for vary from team to team.</p>

		<p>Onboard is the process of giving rookies access to the tools as well as information that they need in order to begin working. Onboarding is usually done by a Director who did the interview or by the Membership Chair. While there is usually little challenge in executing the tasks outlined here, the cost of not doing them can be high. Members may skip important meetings when they aren’t added the internal calendar, they can miss out on important discussions when they can’t check Slack. These situations can be very frustrating to the people involved.</p>
