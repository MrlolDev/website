	</header>
	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		
<p>We organize the work we do in three categories, which we call “tracks”. Work related to logistics of organizing events (eg. finding a space, providing food) is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">events track</code>. Work related to talking to students, teachers and staff (eg. publicizing an event, writing our newsletter, making suggestions to the department) is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">community track</code>. Work related to talking to third-parties (eg. inviting speakers, bringing recruiters to campus) is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">partnerships track</code>. Each of our members specializes in a track, according to our skills and aspirations. Someone’s track determines their responsibilities in the teams they work with.</p>

<p>Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">teams</code> are groups of members working on a certain project. Each team can have members from multiple tracks, depending on their needs. The team for recruiting events probably needs partnerships people more than anything else. Our newsletter team, however, doesn’t need any events or partnerships work.</p>

<p>We can distribute our members in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">matrix of tracks and teams</code>, like so.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Teams \ Tracks</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Events</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Community</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Partnerships</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Study sessions</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Recruiting</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Our actual matrix of tracks and teams is constantly evolving, as our goals and resources change. At the end of each semester, teams are dissolved and the members come together for a <a href="#postmortem">postmortem</a>. At the beginning of each semester, the board can decide to continue the team, sometimes with different members or goals.</p>

<p>Each team is assigned to one or two <code class="highlighter-rouge">team leads</code>: members responsible for coordinating the work and pushing the team towards their goal. Every week, leads attend the board meeting to report to their directors the updates on <a href="#trello">tasks</a> and <a href="#metrics">metrics</a>. Team leads are usually determined by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">predominant track</code> of their project. For example, in the matrix of tracks and teams above, the team lead of <em>study sessions</em> would probably be someone in events, while the <em>recruiting sessions</em> could also use a team lead in partnerships.</p>

<p>Newcomers in our society are <code class="highlighter-rouge">noobs</code>. Their first project with us is marked by constant learning and overcoming of challenges. Before joining a team, noobs have to choose a track to specialize in. This choice will determine the work they do in their teams, as well as the directors that they work with. By the end of the semester, noobs are vetted and become <code class="highlighter-rouge">official members</code>.</p>

<p>By the end of their first year, members they can be tapped to become <code class="highlighter-rouge">directors</code> and join our board. Our board of directors plays an important role of support to our teams. Each director helps members of their own track, usually spread over a couple of teams, to make progress in their tasks. A Director of Community, for instance, may work with two members doing publicity work for a study session, as well as with the lead of the team doing the newsletters. Directors must be in constant touch with their members, touching base at least a couple of times per week. Directors can strongly advise but never make decisions for their pupils.</p>

<p>After one semester in the board, directors can petition to become <code class="highlighter-rouge">chairs</code>. Chairs are a handful of executive positions dedicated to advancing our society and shaping its culture. Chairs are an extra responsibility on top of a director’s role of supporting teams.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Chairperson</code> is .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vice chairperson</code> is .</p>

<p>Three important transitions happen at the end of each semester, by no later than the weekend of reading period.</p>

<p>During the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vetting of the noobs</code>, the current board comes together to vet noobs to become official members of our society. The membership decision is determined by the majority of present directors. <em>Memberships can be deferred</em>, for instance, noobs who didn’t yet demonstrate commitment or ability to work effectively with others.</p>

<p>In the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tapping of directors</code>, the current board members chooses ordinary members to become directors and join the board. During deliberation, directors who have worked with each of these members make the case for making them directors. The result is determined by the <em>majority of present directors</em>. Members tapped may deny the offer to become directors.</p>

<p>During the <code class="highlighter-rouge">petition of chairs</code>, members of the newly elected board get together to choose the new chairs. Directors who are petitioning for a chair should make the case for their relevant skills and experience, and show commitment and a vision for the society. Deliberations end only when an absolute majority supports each association in a bijective mapping of chairs to directors. <strong>This takes several hours.</strong> Seniors and rising seniors can’t petition nor vote. Directors can be reelected for the same chair once.</p>

		<p>Our society relies on a handful of tools in order to work effectively.</p>

<h3 id="planning-and-executing">Planning and Executing</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://trello.com/b/npYqD3Ha/ycs-spring-17">Trello board</a> is the source of truth for our organization. We use cards inside our board to distribute work and keep track of everyone’s tasks and deadlines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every member should have a Trello account associated to our board and check it regularly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>

<p>We use <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> in order to communicate with one with one another. We usually have one big channel for each org (e.g. Events) and one channel per team (e.g. Talks). Our domain on Slack is <a href="http://yalecs.slack.com">yalecs.slack.com</a>.</p>

<p>Good communication a crucial quality for any organization. For this reason, it is very important that every one of our members be active on Slack. We strongly recommend installing in your phones and keeping it open in your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Note about Facebook Messenger</strong> 
Using Messenger for ephemeral communications with team members is OK. As a rule of thumb, Messenger groups shouldn’t last more than a couple of days. Once that happens, please consider transferring that group to Slack.</p>

<h4 id="ycs-in-mailing-list">YCS-IN mailing list</h4>

<p>We use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/elilists.yale.edu/forum/#!forum/ycs-in">ycs-in mailing list</a>, managed by the Yale ITS, for some communications and reminders. Don’t be afraid of using it.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-sheet">Metrics Sheet</h3>

<p>The most important document in our Google Drive folder is our Metric Spreadsheet. It is used to keep track of the progress of our orgs, teams and sometimes of individual members. Managers often must pay special attention to this spreadsheet and update it weekly before meetings. <a href="https://github.com/yalecs/playbook/wiki/Process:Metrics">Learn more about our metrics system.</a></p>

<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>

<p>We use an internal Google calendar associated to yale.edu accounts to coordinate meetings. All new members should be given access to it and add it to their personal calendars.</p>

<h3 id="file-sharing">File Sharing</h3>

<p>We use a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3omFvP_R7pQa2lnd3Z0bTg4S3c">Google Drive folder</a> to keep all of our documents. We prefer adding documents to this Drive folder than sharing it with individual members using their emails. Our society strives for transparency and we trust each other, so there is rarely the need to keep any files relevant to our work outside of this folder.</p>

		<p>If you were part of an extracurricular organization before, chances are that you have mixed feelings about meetings. When done wrong, club meetings are a huge time sink that busy college students just can’t afford. When done right, however, meetings are a powerful tool in coordinating a team and making progress.</p>

<p>In our club, we find that <strong>meetings are the main reason why we are able to get things done, despite our packed schedules</strong>. That is because we use meetings to enforce accountability, drive teams to face their issues and make progress. For college students with busy schedules, physical meetings with fixed times are the best way to get everyone on the same page and communicate critical things.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-hosts">Tips for hosts</h3>

<p>If you are hosting a meeting</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do your homework</strong><br />
Rule zero for hosting is to come prepared. Make sure you have a plan for what is going to be discussed during that time. It is good practice to ping the attendees beforehand, reminding them about the meeting and about work they are supposed to have done by then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make a list of commitments</strong><br />
Once the meeting is done, you will want to know when to follow up about work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ask for attention</strong><br />
It’s OK to ask people to lower their laptop lids.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have a fixed meeting time</strong>, then <strong>start on time and end on time</strong><br />
It’s a big responsibility to ask your team to take a bit of their day.
Stick to 30 minutes. Start on time, finish on time.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tips-for-participants">Tips for participants</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do your homework.</strong><br />
This doesn’t apply only to hosts. Come prepared for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Planning, no working<br />
Unless otherwise noted, plan, don’t work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be focused</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give feedback</p>

	</header>
	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		<p>“How many people came to the last event? How many likes did our Facebook post get? What is the average number of visualizations of the newsletter?” These are some of the questions that we ask ourselves on a weekly basis as we try to understand how our teams are doing and how they can improve. We call the answers to these questions our <strong>“metrics” – numbers that help us assess the performance and impact of the work we do</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at how we use metrics in a couple of our projects.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-measure-a-subjective-goal">Metrics measure a subjective goal</h3>

<p>Our newsletter team is responsible for sending out weekly emails that inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. Here are some questions they ask themselves ever so often:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In what day of the week should we send the newsletter?”<br />
“Do we need to improve the current design of emails?”<br />
“Should we change the email subject lines to make them clearer?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In making decisions like these, we must try to frame what we hope to accomplish in terms of relevant metrics.</strong> In the case of the newsletter, we want to increase the number of subscribers, the rate of visualizations per email, the average clicks that a certain link gets etc. <strong>That is because we believe that these indicators are correlated with our underlying goal</strong>, which, as said before, is to inform and excite students about upcoming events and opportunities. We use these metrics before it is impossible to measure directly how much we inform and excite students. So if a new format of subject lines increases the number of clicks, it tells us that engagement has probably gone up, so the newsletter team should probably use it. If a new design does the opposite, engagement has probably decreased; the team might want to roll it back.</p>

<p>The email tool used by the newsletter team (ie. MailChimp) should take care of providing the most important statistics for them. But tracking success is not always that easy. Some teams might need to sweat a bit to collect their data.</p>

<h3 id="metrics-can-be-tricky">Metrics can be tricky</h3>

<p><strong>Measuring is not always straightforward.</strong> It sometimes requires special effort of teams to track attendance, survey students, write down page stats from Facebook etc. Take, for example, the team responsible for hosting our study sessions. What metrics can they use to measure the success of their events? An obvious place to start would be to count the number of attendees – say, by having a volunteer count the number of students who walk into the room. This metric should certainly correlate with the success of our event, right? Yes, but not always! What happens, for instance, when during a particularly underfunded season our study session team is not able to provide food for the participants? We might find that a lot of the people show up to find no cookies and… tip-toe out of the room less than five minutes later. In this case, the number of attendees in itself no longer paints an accurate picture of how the event went, does it?</p>

<p>Here you might be thinking that what we actually want to measure is the total student-hours spent inside that room. <em>But who’s going to volunteer to measure that?!</em> What seems, in theory, like a better metric might be impractical to measure. <strong>If something is too hard to measure, it’s of no use to us.</strong></p>

<p>There is no silver lining here: measuring is very tricky sometimes. <strong>It is up to the individual teams to define what metrics they will use to define success and, if necessary, change to better suit the situations.</strong></p>

<p>Every now and then, the newsletter team will meet to reevaluate the metrics they use and, in terms those metrics, determine what they want to achieve in what period of time. Let’s see how this process works.</p>

<h1 id="metrics-at-ycs">Metrics at YCS</h1>

<p>The spreadsheet containing all of our metrics <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLYrQrd-UTvufIzzDQ3Dmyy7skhIQh9CD8W_69eHE_M/edit">lives in our shared folder and is available to all of our members</a>. Each team has its own tab where they fill in, week after week, their metrics.</p>

<p>Our template tab looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JZG89ZP.png?1" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Picking the right metrics won’t matter unless we commit to following up on them.</strong> That is why we look at them every week during meetings. During board meetings, team managers will bring the latest numbers and discuss them with the rest of the board.</p>

<h3 id="health-execution-and-impact">Health, Execution and Impact</h3>

<p>We like to differentiate between three categories of metrics, according to the purpose they serve.</p>

<h4 id="health-metrics">Health metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What is the average rate of absence in our meetings?”<br />
“What rate of our members marked themselves ‘dissatisfied’ with the work we do?”<br />
“How many people attended our retreat?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Mens sana in corpore sano</em>. Only a healthy team can keep doing amazing work in the long run. That’s why we have metrics to try to measure how well we are working together over time.</p>

<p><strong>Health metrics are at the same time the most important ones and the trickiest to measure.</strong></p>

<h4 id="execution-metrics">Execution metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many speakers did we reach out to?”<br />
“How many events did we organize this semester?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These questions help us track the work we accomplish to do in objective ways. Execution tasks act as follow up to delegated work.</p>

<h4 id="impact-metrics">Impact metrics</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How many responded to our Facebook event?”<br />
“What is the view rate of our last newsletter?”<br />
“How many students said ‘very important’ when surveyed about YCS’s importance?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Impact metrics help us assess the impact of our projects. Some projects, especially events, can only measure their impact <em>after</em> they finish.</p>

	<div class="body markdown-body">
		
		<p>In most cases, the board will be opening an application form a couple of weeks before each semester, closing it after the first week of class. After that date the board should sit together to review and discuss  the applicants’ responses. They should begin by selecting the students who seem aligned with YCS’ values and its current composition, and then proceed to distribute adequate applicants into each of our teams. The distribution should be based on the students’ demonstrated interests, skills and commitment, and how those are likely to fit into each team. After this triage, each director will be responsible for interviewing in person their respective applicants. The rest of the board should be let known, probably via a spreadsheet, of when each of the interviews will be happening, so they can sit in and help.</p>

<p>In the special case that the board fails to distribute a qualified person into a specific team, it is up for the p/vp to interview them.</p>

<p>If, in conducting an interview, a director thinks the student they’re interviewing would rather fit in another group, they should finish the interview by trying to assess fit to this other team.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling-interviews">Scheduling interviews</h2>

<p>To schedule interviews, you should create an online form that students can use to sign up for interview slots. We recommend using <a href="http://doodle.com/">doodle.com</a> – make sure to double-check that applicants can select the right times. Keep in mind the number of students you have to interview and be prepared to have to reschedule due to conflicts of some of them.</p>

<p>After creating the signup form for interviews, you should email them. It is a good idea to send personalized emails where you greet them by their first names (NOTE:  You can use a mail merge system to accomplish that. Nylas has that built in.) and thank them for applying. We really want new members to know that we care. Make sure you also introduce yourself and let them know that <strong>you</strong> personally selected them as a good candidate for whatever team you’re on.</p>

<h2 id="conducting-interviews">Conducting interviews</h2>

<p>While the interviews will be mostly conducted at the discretion of the director in charge, a few things are strongly advised.</p>

<p>First of all, understand that the interview depends much more on you than on the person you will be interviewing, so <strong>make sure to prepare</strong> accordingly. Make sure you re-read the applicant’s responses and the observations made by you and the rest of the board during the triage. Interview questions should be tailored to asking follow-ups to their written application and understanding more about their fit to the club, considering fit/ambition, commitment and skills (NOTE:  Probably in that order.).</p>

<p><strong>Make sure you schedule consecutive slots of around 40 minutes</strong>, so you can interview for 30 to 35 minutes and then breathe and prepare for at least five. Do make sure you have time to pee and drink water in between candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Take as many notes as you can.</strong> After the interview process is over, you will likely have to come back and compare candidates and that won’t be an easy task. You will be glad you have notes to read. Taking notes on candidates’ responses will help you remember who is who, and even ask someone who didn’t sit on the interviews for help evaluating a candidate. Keep in mind that note taking is a skill that takes practice. Here are a few resources on this.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>make sure candidates can commit to the club</strong>. If they are taking hard classes that semester and very involved in other extracurricular commitments, maybe you should suggest that they defer their application by a semester. Many of us can go through an entire application process before actually considering whether we will have the time to put into that activity. It is <strong>your responsibility to convey to them the expectation that are implied in the positions they are about to sign up for</strong>. This, of course, will depend on the team they are interviewing for. Candidates should also be available to attend our general meetings every week (now at 8pm on Sundays) – very few exceptions should be made for this.</p>

<h2 id="bank-of-questions-with-commentary">Bank of questions with commentary</h2>

<p>Here is a bank of questions you can draw from, with commentary. They are separated into the traits they test for, between <strong>fit/ambition</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong> and <strong>skill</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="fitambition">Fit/ambition</h3>

<p>The purpose of these is to gauge if the applicant is aligned with YCS’ mission of working hard to improve the tech community at Yale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Why do you want to be part of our team?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of our biggest challenges is to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is one thing you wish existed at Yale to?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some things you think are lacking with computer science at Yale?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some ideas you have for improving CS at Yale?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could you describe briefly what steps you would take to execute one of those ideas?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What got you interested in CS/technology?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment</h3>

<p>You want to make sure that the student can commit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are your other extracurricular commitments this semester?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you free to attend our general meetings?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="skill">Skill</h3>

<p>The skills you want to check for vary from team to team.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me more about your experience doing X in high school.</li>
</ul>

		<p>This section outlines the process of getting new members into our organization.</p>

<p>While there is usually little challenge in executing the tasks outlined here, the cost of not doing them can be high. Members may skip important meetings when they aren’t added the internal calendar, they can miss out on important discussions when they can’t check Slack. These situations can be very frustrating to the people involved.</p>

<p>We are always working on a multitude of initiatives to help the community we serve, some of which can be quite risky. They might be ventures never successfully accomplished before or projects that require a lot of preliminary investment but which can flop at anytime. Some initiatives might even expose our reputation, making it harder to maintain members and partners. <strong>In order to continue thriving despite these odds, we focus on making the best decisions we can – as quickly as we can – even in face of uncertainty.</strong></p>
