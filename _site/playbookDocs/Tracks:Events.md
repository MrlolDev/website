Inviting speakers. Arranging their arrival, departure and escorting them as we sit fit (dinner with YCS before the talk). Getting sponsorship for travelling requirements. Promoting the event through Facebook and inviting students. Reserving appropriate space for the talks. Recording the event and uploading it to YCS Youtube account. Sharing the video through our social media and on other channels (eg: share to HackerNews). Coming up with the content of the questions. Arranging interviewer (might be one of us, or a third party). We might need sponsorship (or just find it useful to have it) for some of our talks.
